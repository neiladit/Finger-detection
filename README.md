Finger-detection
================

A Linux-based application for live motion 
gesture recognition using webcam input in C++. This 
application uses the webcam to detect gesture made by the 
user and perform basic operations accordingly. The user has to 
perform a particular gesture. The webcam captures this and 
identifies the gesture, recognises it (against a set of known 
gestures) and performs the action corresponding to it. This is 
very useful for a hands-free approach.
